I have finished the html part of making a recipes website, in this project 
i put to test my newly acquired html and git skills.

 - I had to memorize most elements i read about in The Odin Project up until now.

 - I tried to write the commit messages in the most concise way i could 

What I think i can improve:

 - Use more text emphasis elements (strong and em)

 - Text Formatting

 - Make more constant, small commits
