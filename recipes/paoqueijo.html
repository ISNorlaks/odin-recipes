        <li>Next, put the grated cheese and a little bit of the plate cheese and also 1 egg, continue mixing well.</li>
        <li>Put the rest of the cheese and verify if the dough is with good texture, not too oily neither too dry.</li>
        <li>If you think it's too dry, add another egg, if it's too oily, add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li>The dough shouldn't stick to your hand or the bowl.</li>
        <li>Taste the flour and see if it's enough salt (it's to your liking).</li>
        <li>Now just make some small balls and put them in the baking dish, leaving a little space between the breads.</li>
        <li>It's not necessary to oil the baking dish.</li>
