    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Brazilian pudding is a creamy dessert, with a slightly yellowish hue and a caramel sauce that adds flavor.
     This delicacy is believed to have been inspired by priscos pudding, a Portuguese dessert.</p>    

    <p>However, over time, the pudding went through some variations. Before the popularization of condensed milk, whole milk was one of the main ingredients used to prepare it.
     It was only in the 19th century that the pudding gained its characteristic ingredients.
    This combination results in a Brazilian dessert appreciated around the world for its creaminess and flavor,
    especially when combined with caramel sauce.</p>
